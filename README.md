# COGS118A Project template
Our goal is to be able to successfully be able to predict whether or not to buy or sell stock from the S&P500 based on various factors. Since we wanted to have ample data points we chose to have our data range from 1985 - 2022. The main factors we decided on was daily candle stick data, economics-related news sentiment of a given day, gold rates, and oil/energy prices. Since we wanted to predict whether or not we should by stock we performed various binary classification algorithms. What determined if the algorithm worked well was if it succesfully predicted buy or sell (1 & -1). Whether or not if something should be bought was if the average of high and low was greater than zero and sell if it was less than zero. High and low where standardized with sklearn's StandardScaler package before the average was calculated. What we saw was that logistic regression was the best at predicting buy or sell with an accuarcy of 70%. This meant that it was able to successfully predict whether to buy or sell 70% of the time. We had 810 false positives and 42 false negatives. So this model does the best at not selling when it isn't suppose to. The other models had similar false postive and false negative rate so they do not provide anything more benefical than our logistic regression model.
